# Jupyter, Python and Pandas

[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) is a browser-based programming environment which allows a mix of code and rich text for creating shareable documents called notebooks that can contain a mix of html, formulas, charts and step by step code with output.

## Example

Jupyter notebooks are used widley in academia and science. They can be used to create homework assignments, explore datasets, present results, and explain various topics. Multiple programming languges are supported. We used [Python](https://www.python.org/) with the [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library, which provides R & Excel-like functions for cleaning, wrangling, analysing and plotting data.

The goal was to take a sample of NBA data, clean it up a bit, and chart the best three point shooters in history to see if anyone was more than two standard deviations above the mean. We found an "alien" outlier.

You can try out Jupyter here: [http://try.jupyter.org/](http://try.jupyter.org/)

This repo has the slides (.pdf), a notebook (.ipynb), and a dataset (.csv) of nba players.

You may wish to use Anaconda to install the tools needed
